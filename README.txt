Finished the assignments and this should be a working version of the finished assignment. 

# Things to add
1. Reset button. Instead of having to reload the page, upon completion of the game, there should be a reset button to start the game again. The button should be made in HTML and set to an event in the JavaScript file.

2. Keep track of the score
As the player plays the game, there should be a visible scoreboard, which can be updated automatically by JS.

3. Ability to display the score in real time

4. Randomise the cards
This would allow the game to be significantly improved so that the guessing element of the game is increased.

5. Add addition cards
Expand upon the original game by adding more cards to the game.
